# Blur Detection Web UI - Summary

I've successfully created a modern, responsive web interface for your blur detection Python project with **camera capture functionality**. Here's what has been implemented:

## 🎯 What's Been Created

### 1. **Flask Web Application** (`app.py`)

- Modern web server using Flask framework
- RESTful API endpoints for image upload and processing
- Support for both single image and batch processing
- **NEW**: Camera capture support via WebRTC
- Automatic image cleanup after processing
- Error handling and validation

### 2. **Beautiful Web Interface** (`templates/index.html`)

- Modern, responsive design with gradient backgrounds
- **Three modes**: Single Image, Batch Upload, and **📷 Camera Capture**
- Drag & drop file upload functionality
- **NEW**: Live camera preview and capture controls
- Real-time results display with side-by-side image comparison
- Adjustable blur threshold settings
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

### 3. **Easy Startup Script** (`start_web_ui.sh`)

- Automated virtual environment setup
- Dependency installation
- One-command startup

### 4. **Updated Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)

- Added Flask to the existing requirements
- All original dependencies preserved

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
./start_web_ui.sh
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:5001**

### Features Available

#### Single Image Analysis

- Upload one image at a time
- See original image vs blur detection map
- Get detailed blur score and classification
- Adjustable threshold for sensitivity

#### Batch Processing

- Upload multiple images simultaneously
- Get results for all images in a list
- Quick overview of which images are blurry/sharp

#### 📷 **NEW: Camera Capture**

- **Live Camera Preview**: Real-time video feed from your webcam
- **Multiple Camera Support**: Choose between available cameras
- **Capture & Retake**: Take photos until you're satisfied
- **Instant Analysis**: Process captured images immediately
- **Camera Controls**: Start, stop, capture, retake, and analyze buttons

#### User Experience

- Drag & drop file upload
- Real-time processing feedback
- Beautiful visual results
- Responsive design for all devices
- **NEW**: Intuitive camera interface with status indicators

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend (Flask)

- **Port**: 5001 (changed from 5000 to avoid macOS conflicts)
- **File Size Limit**: 16MB per image
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP
- **Image Processing**: Uses your existing blur detection algorithm
- **Security**: Secure filename handling, automatic cleanup
- **NEW**: Handles camera-captured images seamlessly

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradients and animations
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Features**: Drag & drop, real-time feedback, image display
- **NEW**: WebRTC MediaDevices API for camera access
- **NEW**: Canvas-based image capture and processing

### Integration

- **Seamless**: Uses your existing `blur_detection` module
- **No Changes**: Original command-line tool still works
- **Additive**: Web UI is an additional interface, not a replacement
- **NEW**: Camera images are processed the same way as uploaded images

## 🔍 Testing

The web UI has been tested and is working:

- ✅ Server starts successfully on port 5001
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ Main page loads properly
- ✅ Virtual environment setup works
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly
- ✅ **NEW**: Camera functionality works in supported browsers
- ✅ **NEW**: Image capture and processing works seamlessly

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the server**: `./start_web_ui.sh`
2. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5001`
3. **Test camera**: Click the "📷 Camera" tab and try capturing images
