5. View the results showing:
   - Original image
   - Blur detection map
   - Blur score and classification (Sharp/Blurry)

### Batch Analysis

2. Select multiple images
3. Adjust the blur threshold if needed
4. Click "Process Images"
5. View results for all images in a list format

### üì∑ Camera Capture

**Camera Features:**

- **Multiple Camera Support**: Choose between available cameras
- **Live Preview**: See what you're capturing in real-time
- **Capture & Retake**: Take multiple photos until you're satisfied
- **Instant Analysis**: Get blur detection results immediately after capture

## Understanding Results

- **Blur Score**: Higher values indicate sharper images
- **Threshold**: Images with scores below the threshold are classified as blurry
- **Blur Map**: Visual representation showing which areas of the image are blurry (darker areas = more blurry)

## Technical Details

- Built with Flask (Python web framework)
- Uses the existing blur detection algorithm from the original project
- Supports common image formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP
- Maximum file size: 16MB per image
- Images are automatically resized to HD resolution for consistent scoring
- Camera capture uses WebRTC MediaDevices API for browser compatibility

## Browser Compatibility

The camera functionality works in modern browsers that support the MediaDevices API:

- Chrome 53+
- Firefox 36+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 12+

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues

- If images fail to upload, check the file format and size
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
- Check the console for any error messages
- If port 5001 is in use, you can modify the port in `app.py`

### Camera Issues

- **Camera not starting**: Make sure you've granted camera permissions to the website
- **No camera detected**: Check if your camera is connected and not being used by another application
- **Permission denied**: Click the camera icon in your browser's address bar to grant permissions
- **Multiple cameras**: Use the camera dropdown to select the correct camera
- **Mobile devices**: Ensure you're using HTTPS if accessing from a mobile device (camera requires secure context)

## Privacy & Security

- Camera access requires explicit user permission
- Captured images are processed locally and not stored permanently
- Images are automatically cleaned up after processing
- No camera data is transmitted to external servers
